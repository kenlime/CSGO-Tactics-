              <h1>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h1>
              <h2>Team Based Tactics</h2>

              <a class="floatright" href="images/stadium_big.jpg"><img src="images/stadium_small.jpg" alt="CS:GO Live"></a>

              <p>Counter Strike: Global Offensive, commonly shortened to CSGO,
                is a team based, first person shooter (FPS), and is one of the
                most popular games in the global competitive gaming community.
                It outweighs the popularity of both Call of Duty and Battlefield.
                Both of which are very big names in the FPS market.</p>

              <p>CSGO has a number of game modes that all can be played as a
                  single player.  However, it is best played, with a well oiled
                  team, working together.  This web site will focus exclusively
                  on the competitive game mode, explain certain aspects of CSGOâ€™s
                  gameplay mechanics and show examples of how a team can play
                  together.</p>

              <h1>Basic Mechanics</h1>
              <h2>Team Objectives</h2>
              <br>


              <p>The goal of the Terrorist team is to plant a bomb at one of two
                designated bomb-sites.  Discordantly, the goal of the Counter-Terrorist
                team is to stop the Terrorist team from letting the bomb go off.</p>

              <h2>Game Layout</h2>

              <p>Each game consist of two, five man, teams: Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist.
                Games are best out of 30 rounds (first to 16), with a halftime
                after round 15.  At halftime, teams switch sides. Meaning the
                Terrorist become the Counter-Terrorist and visa versa.</p>

              <p>Each round is two minutes long and can be won in one of three
                ways: one team kills all five members of the opposing team; the
                bomb explodes; or the bomb is defused.  Most commonly a round is
                won with one team killing all five members of the opposing team.</p>

              <h2>Bomb Mechanics</h2>

              <a class="floatleft" href="images/bombplant_big.jpg"><img src="images/bombplant_small.jpg" alt="Bomb Plant"></a>

              <p>As said earlier, the goal of the Terrorist team is to plant a
                bomb at one of two designated bomb-sites.  Planting the bomb takes
                four seconds.  Then the Terrorist team must defend the bomb until
                it explodes, 35 seconds later.  After the bomb is planted, a member
                of the Counter-Terrorist team can defuse the bomb.  It takes 10
                seconds to defuse the bomb without a defuse kit and five seconds
                with a defuse kit.</p>
